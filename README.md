# Flooding impact assessment with Jupyter Notebooks

In this example use case, we are asked to build a Python Notebook to assess the impact of floodings during the Gloria storm (Januray 15th-25th, 2020) in the municipality of Tordera, which is located along the Tordera river (Catalonia, Spain).

We are going to calculate the following analytics:

- Number of square kilometers affected by the flooding.
- The affected population.
- The affected roads.
